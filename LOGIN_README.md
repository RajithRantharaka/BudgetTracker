# Login Link

The application is running!

**Login Page:** [http://localhost:5174/login](http://localhost:5174/login)
*(Note: Since port 5173 was in use, it likely switched to 5174. If that doesn't work, try 5173 or 5175).*

## Important
Ensure you have set up your `.env` file with Supabase keys as described in `DEPLOYMENT.md`, otherwise the login button will fail.
